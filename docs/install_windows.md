# Aquaria randomizer Windows installation

To play the Aquaria randomizer, you need to own a copy of the original Aquaria game. The game can be bought in almost every online game sellers (GOG, Steam, etc.)

To install the randomizer, unzip the Aquaria randomizer release and copy all unzipped files in the Aquaria original game folder. The unzipped files
are those:
- aquaria_randomizer.exe
- OpenAL32.dll
- randomizer_files (directory)
- SDL2.dll
- usersettings.xml
- wrap_oal.dll
- cacert.pem

If there is a conflict between file in the original game folder and the unzipped files, you should override the original files with the one of the unzipped randomizer.

Once the randomizer is installed you can launch it. For details about the execution options, see: [execution_windows.md](execution_windows.md)
